# AHG_OCR_Pipeline_v2

This repository contains the source code and test images for the Automagic Hacker Glasses OCR + Voice pipeline.  
To keep the submission size under 100 MB, large resource files have been removed.

## Missing Resources
The following files are required to run the full pipeline:
- `resources/vosk_model_small/` (Vosk small English model)
- `resources/east_model.pb` (EAST OCR model)
- `resources/corpus_freqs.json` (Corpus frequency data)
